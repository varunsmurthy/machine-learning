### 1a: Non-Linear Hypotheses

* Regression and classification problems can sometimes have a large number of features (e.g., consider a 100 x 100 pixel image classification problem, where each pixel is a feature)and often need quadratic terms as features (i.e. $x_1^2, x_1x_2,..$. However, the number of term scales as $n^2/2$ and becomes very large for large n (where n is the number of features).
