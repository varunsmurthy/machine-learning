# Week 5: Neural Networks (Learning)

## Lecture 1: Cost Function and Back Propagation

### 1a: Cost Function

Let's first define a few variables that we will need to use:

a) $L$ = total number of layers in the network

b) $s_l$ = number of units (not counting bias unit) in layer l

c) $K$ = number of output units or classes
