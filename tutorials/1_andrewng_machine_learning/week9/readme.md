## 9 Part 1: Anomaly Detection

## Lecture 1: Density Estimation

### 1a: Problem Motivation

* Detect anomalous features: faulty product in manufactoring, fraudulent user on website, disfunctional computer in datacenter.  
* Model representation: if $p(x) > \epsilon$, not anomalous, if $p(x) < \epsilon$, anomalous.
